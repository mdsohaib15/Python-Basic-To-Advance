# Exception Handling:
# Exception handling is the process of responding to unwanted or unexpected events when a computer program runs. Exception handling deals with these events to avoid the program or system crashing, and without this process, exceptions would disrupt the normal operation of a program.
# try:
     #statements which could generate 
     #exception
# except:
     #Soloution of generated exception

print(f"Multiplication table of {a} is: ")
try:

    print(f"{int(a)} X {i} = {int(a)*i}")
except:
  print("Invalid  Input!")


print("Some imp lines of code")
print("End of program")

try:
    num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
    a = [6, 3]
    print(a[num])
except ValueError:
    print("Number entered is not an integer.")
